## R Markdown

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat=39.328888, lng=-76.620277, popup="Johns Hopkins University") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=51,202465, lng=10,382203, popup = "Germany")
map
```
